Here is my Ohmyfood project. I will edit this project more in detail as I progress with comments. This project could have been more straightforward.
My Issues:
 At first, I messed up and approached the design in a desktop-to-mobile design way which told messed up the breakpoints. Second, the issue was with the page spinner, and I couldn't figure out how the animation was on the screen. Last, the major problem was utilizing Git. 

Solution
it and fun to learn about what I could do with animation, and the challenge was making the media query for each display and making them look nice for each screen size. I realized I had to use an opacity and z index property.
